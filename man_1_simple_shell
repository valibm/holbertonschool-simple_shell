.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
The purpose of using simple shell is to be provided with a command-line interface to interact with the operating system. It interprets user commands and executes programs. This shell supports basic functionalities such as command execution, I/O redirection, environment variable management, and scripting.
.PP
Users can execute commands directly from the command line or specify a file containing commands. 
.PP
This shell serves as a fundamental tool for understanding command-line interfaces, process management, and basic scripting in an operating system environment.
.PP

.SH INTERACTIVE MODE COMMANDS
.PP
When running the shell in interactive mode, users have access to the following built-in commands:
.PP
\fBhelp\fR: Display help information about shell built-in commands. Usage: `help`.
.PP
\fBexit\fR: Exit the shell. Usage: `exit`.
.PP
These commands are available to provide assistance and control when using the shell interactively. The `help` command provides information about built-in functionalities, while `exit` allows users to terminate the shell session.

.SH FUNCTIONS
.TP
.B char *find_path(char *command)
Concentrates the command name with each directory specified in the PATH until it finds an executable file matching the command.
.TP
.B char *_getenv(char *env)
Takes an environment varibale name as an argument and then searches in the array to find a match for it.

.TP
.B void _env(void)
Iterates through the array and prints env varibales to the stdout by using "printf".
.TP
.B int execute(char **args)
Handles the execution of commands by using \fBfork\fR.

.SH USAGE
To use the simple shell, include the header file \fImain.h\fR in your source code.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example shows how to use commands and options on the shell and execute them:
.PP
To run a command:
.PP
\fB"ls -a"\fR
.PP
This executes the "ls -a" command using the shell in a non-interactive mode.
.PP
To execute commands from a file:
.PP
\fB child_funcs.c\fR
.PP
Running the child_funcs.c file with the shell executes the commands written in the script.
.PP
To start an interactive shell:
.PP
\fBsh\fR
.PP
This launches the shell in interactive mode, allowing users to enter commands directly and interactively.
